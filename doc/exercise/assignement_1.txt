Assignment 1: Working with Nucleotide Sequences in Python
=========================================================

In this assignment, you will work with randomly generated DNA sequences and perform various
operations using Python. This exercise will help you practice essential programming concepts,
including variables, lists, functions, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

Exercise A
----------
A.1 Construct a variable that contains 16 randomly selected nucleotides (that is a sequence).
A.2 Generate a list of 50 sequences generated in point A.1
A.3 Write a function to do point A.2.
A.4 Use the function A.3 to generate two lists of 10000 sequences.

TIP: you can use the class developed in class for each of the task of this exercise.


Exercise B
----------
B.1 Make a function that compare the two lists generated in A.4 and gives how many sequences
are present in both lists.
B.2 Save in a dictionary the sequences are present in both lists and how many times the
sequences are present in both lists.

TIP: You need to use a nested for loop (one for loop inside the other) 


Exercise C
----------
C.1 Make a histogram with the list of B.2.
C.2 Construct a class that contains the methods you generated in the points A.3 to C.1.
C.3 Use the class written in C.2 to make the histogram of point C.1.

TIP: Use the notebook for the histogram developed in class. For C.3 you can make a function inside the class.


General tip. Work out the notebook developed in class, these exercises requires very little code development, it is mostly an application
of what we went over in class. You do not need more concepts to solve these other than the tools presented in class.
